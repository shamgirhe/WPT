    <h2>How do Volcano Erupt?</h2>
    <div>It is so hot deep within the earth that some rocks slowly melt and turn into a thick flowing matter known as
        magma. Since it is lighter than solid rock, the magma rises and collects in magma chambers. Eventually, some
        magma pushes through fissures and vents on the earth’s surface. Hence, a volcanic eruption occurs, and the
        erupted magma is known as lava.

        We need to understand the Earth’s structure to know how volcanoes erupt. At the top lies the lithosphere, the
        outermost layer that consists of the upper crust and mantle. The thickness of the crust ranges from 10km to
        100km in mountainous locations and mainly consists of silicate rock.</div>

    <p><h2>Why Do Volcano Erupts?</h2></p>
    <div>The Earth’s mantle within the crust is classified into
        different sections depending on individual seismology. These include the upper mantle, which ranges between 8 –
        35 km to 410 km; the transition zone ranges from 400 to 660 km; the lower mantle lies between 660 – 2891 km.

        The conditions change dramatically from the crust to the mantle location. The pressures rise drastically and
        temperatures rise up to 1000 oC. This viscous and molten rock gets collected into large chambers within the
        Earth’s crust.</div>

    <p>Since magma is lighter than surrounding rock, it floats up
        towards the surface and seeks out cracks and weakness in the mantle. It finally explodes from the peak point of
        a volcano after reaching the surface. When it is under the surface, the melted rock is known as magma and erupts
        as ash when comes up.

        Rocks, lava and ash are built across the volcanic vent with every eruption. The nature of the eruption mainly
        depends on the viscosity of the magma. The lava travels far and generates broad shield volcanoes when it flows
        easily. When it is too thick, it makes a familiar cone volcano shape. If the lava is extremely thick, it can
        build up in the volcano and explode, known as lava domes.</p>

    <br>
    <p>We know that the mantle of the Earth is too hot, and the temperature ranges from 1000° Celsius to 3000° Celsius.
        The rocks present inside melt due to high pressure and temperature. The melted substance is light in weight.
        This thin lava comes up to the crust since it can float easily. Since the density of the magma between the area
        of its creation and the crust is less than the enclosed rocks, the magma gets to the surface and bursts.
        The magma is composed of andesitic and rhyolitic components along with water, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide
        in dissolved form. By forming bubbles, excess water is broken up with magma. When the magma comes closer to the
        surface, the level of water decreases and the gas/magma rises in the channel. When the volume of the bubbles
        formed is about 75%, the magma breaks into pyroclasts and bursts out.
        The three main causes of volcanic eruptions are:
        The buoyancy of the magma
        Pressure from the exsolved gases in the magma
        Increase in pressure on the chamber lid
        Hope you are familiar with why volcanoes erupt and the cause of the volcanic eruption. Stay tuned to BYJU’S to

<h2>Types of Volcanos:</h2>
<p>Volcanoes are grouped into four types:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Cinder Cones:</b><br>
        &nbsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cinder cones are circular or oval cones made up of small
        fragments of lava from a single vent that have been blown up. Cinder cones result from eruptions of mostly small
        pieces of scoria and pyroclastics that build up around the vent.
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;Most cinder cones erupt only once. Cinder cones may form as
        flank vents on larger volcanoes, or occur on their own.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li><b>Comoposite Volcanos:</b><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Composite volcanoes are steep-sided volcanoes composed of many
        layers of volcanic rocks, usually made from high-viscosity lava, ash and rock debris. These types of volcanoes
        are
        tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers, the strata that give rise to
        the
        name.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Shield Volcanos:</b><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Shield volcanoes are volcanoes shaped like a bowl or shield in
        the
        middle with long gentle slopes made by basaltic lava flows. These are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity
        lava
        that can flow a great distance from a vent.
        <br>They generally do not explode catastrophically. Since low-viscosity magma is typically low in silica, shield
        volcanoes are more common in oceanic than continental settings. The Hawaiian volcanic chain is a series of
        shield cones, and they are common in Iceland, as well.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Lava Volcanos:</b>
        <br>
        &emsp;&emsp;Lava domes are formed when erupting lava is too thick to flow
        and makes a steep-sided mound as the lava piles up near the volcanic vent. They are built by slow eruptions of
        highly viscous lava.
        <br>They are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption. Like a composite volcano, they
        can produce violent, explosive eruptions, but their lava generally does not flow far from the originating vent.
