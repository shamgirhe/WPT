        This unevenness of deposition allows for the development of several vents from which gas and magma can escape. Typically, a stratovolcano has one primary vent near its peak. This vent is often located within a crater, where material has been blasted away during one or more previous eruptions. The crater may be filled with water or ice, or it may contain a volcanic dome during a period of relative inactivity. Craters are often unstable features, with the location of the vent changing over time. Other vents associated with the volcano include fumaroles, which emit gas and vapour.

The andesite and dacite rocks common to stratovolcanoes produce cooler and more-viscous lavas than the basalt rocks common to shield volcanoes, which produce faster-moving and less-viscous lavas. Thick extrusions pile up on previous volcanic deposits around the vent of the stratovolcano, and multiple eruptions occurring over thousands of years culminate in tall cone-shaped peaks.

During an eruption, as magma escapes from a chamber within the mountain, a large section of the rock above may give way, and the chamber may collapse. The result is a a large bowl-shaped volcanic depression called a caldera. Calderas are many times larger than the vents that often appear near the top of a stratovolcano, and they are also larger than volcanic craters.

A stratovolcanoâ€™s steep slope and composite structure makes its flanks particularly vulnerable to lahars (mudflows of volcanic material), avalanches, and landslides caused by the collapse of large sections of the mountain. Lahars may be the product of an eruption, or they may result from heavy rain on loose ash or from an unusually quick melt of ice. The massive flow of water, ash, rock, and other volcanic debris can travel great distances to impact communities far from the volcano.
